## Reporting a bug
If you think you've identified a security issue in the whipcode source code or the service running at [whipcode.app](https://whipcode.app), please **do not** report the issue publicly via the GitHub issue tracker. Instead, send an email with as many details as possible to [hello@whipcode.app](mailto:hello@whipcode.app).

Please **do not** create a public issue.

If the bug is not a security issue, feel free to open an issue with the "Bug report" template. Or open a pull request if you already have a fix.
